      "Post content: I hate dogs and dog people.  Dog people have little respect for those who don't share their infatuation for an animal that can be downright dangerous and in fact is when put that in that position.  Dog owners have no respect for people who may have had a traumatic experience or just flat out don't like them. They always try to convince you that their dog is not like the others. They act like people who don't liked dogs are psychopaths or assholes.  So many people let dogs shit all over the sidewalk or on people's lawns.  Dogs attack people in their own household more than people admit and there are hundreds of fatalities a year due to dog attacks.  Know what animal never kills anyone? A cat, even a really pissed off cat. But come face to face with a pissed off pit bull or German Shepard and you might actually die from it. As someone who has had traumatic dog encounters i can also say that when you try to explain to people that you just don't feel comfortable around their dog instead of saying ok they instead go \" oh your afraid of dogs? Here let me bring mine out and have it come up to you and smell how anxious you are\" . You get the picture,  I think dogs are far more dangerous then basically any other pet besides a huge snake.  And dog people are fucking assholes with no respect for people who don't like them.  Fuck dogs.  Fuck their God awful barking and shit piles, fuck pitt bulls, fuck all of it. And to anyone about to spam me with pro dog propaganda,  save your energy.  I don't care, which is why this is on unpopular opinions.\n",

      "\n",
      "He is quite a fearful guy, and took him quite a long time to get used to me being around the house (I think he is more comfortable with women than with men). In the beginning things were great, with the only exception of food - I unfortunately put him through a few different diets including raw food, dry, wet, etc., which obviously wasn't a smart idea. I was only trying to find the best food for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, cut a long story short - in September-October last year he started eating grass quite regularly and started vomiting after a few minutes. After making a few rounds to the vet, they mentioned it could be acidity which is forcing him to want to throw up and hence the grass eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the 1st of January, things got exceptionally bad and he threw up about 6 times in a matter of an hour along with heavy panting and a hunched back- obviously we rushed to the emergency vet and I was told to admit him to a hospital at which point we were told he is suffering from an enlarged prostate and they kept him under care for a week and released him back to me with pain medicine, anti-bacterial pills, and a pill for chemical castration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since he was back, things were going well - until the last month or so where he very randomly started eating grass and throwing up again. This time, our private vet suggested it could possibly be a hypoallergy issue post which she suggested a diet of exotic wet dog food consisting of horse and kangaroo meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "This too, was going good for a bit - but now he is back to licking the floor, and eating grass along with dry heaving / gagging without vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my first dog, and I am just trying to do the best for my buddy but I am not at my wit's end. He has been through blood tests, radiographies, echographies, and hospital stays but nothing seems to change.\n",

      "„ÄåOne More Time„Äç is a time-manipulation type stand. Its first ability allow the user to get back to a place or event that just happend and change it. But there is a catch. After using the ability, Thomas needs to see every parallel universe that exists and pick the best one. But his stand creates a paradox, because choosing a best scenario universe results in the apperance of more alt universes with even better outcomes, that are created by him choosing said universe. The guilt and paranoia of ruining something better destroy mentally Tareecy, so he uses it sparingly. Its second ability is 'Reverce and Repeat'. Anything done in the last hour can be repeated and done in a different way. If the outcome is not good, Thomas can fix it or just leave it be how it was. Third and final ability is 'Punch trough a timeline'. After a barrage of punches, One More Time throws a very  strong punch, which can send the opponent into a different timeline. He can be brought back only if Tareecy is willing to do it.  \n",

      "Post title: Life of an MJ Meme. I'm auctioning an NFT of my viral MJ Thug image from 2003\n",
      "\n",
      "Post content: Sorry in advance to the mods if this isn't appropriate.  This is such a weird/new thing, but I know on reddit there is probably a small crossover of NFT collectors and Michael Jackson fans and I figured there's nowhere better to share this story.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Up front, I was an MJ fan from birth.  Sat front row of his \"Victory Tour\" concert as a baby.  I have relatives who knew him personally.  Some of you have been sharing a copy-pasta of [my pro-MJ rant I made here in 2013 defending his innocence](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1azrsz/30_years_ago_today_michael_jackson_moonwalked_for/c92hfk6/).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Well before that, back in 2003, I was active on various King of Pop message boards.  A rumor surfaced at the time that Michael was planning a collaboration with 50 Cent.  **This idea seemed hilarious to me so I fired up an early version of photoshop (had no idea what I was doing) and made [an image mashup of the two of them](https://i.imgur.com/DPEfFie.jpg).  I titled it mjthug.jpg and posted it to a fan forum**.  They fans there got a kick out of it.  These kind of mashups weren't common at the time.  The word \"meme\" wasn't even in my vocabulary.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It quickly spread to other fan groups.   Eventually in the lead-up to the 2005 trial, I saw the image surface all over the internet with the (somewhat mean) title \"Michael Jackson after Prison\".  I can still find records of the image being shared as far back as 2003 [such as this screenshot from a Lexus forum](https://i.imgur.com/9KMzQR5.jpg) and a reverse image search on tineye shows me it being reposted several times such as the examples from 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014 you see in [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/jiY2VfT.jpg).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was my first time seeing a creation of mine go \"viral\", though it's impossible for me to know just how \"viral\" it went.  It's quite possible this silly image was shared millions of times over the years, peaking during the height of the Myspace era.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was kind of fun to see such a silly thing pop up all over the internet, but as a fan of MJ I was never totally happy that it had been captioned \"MJ after Prison\".  As you know, I was a staunch defender of MJ's innocence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2007, I tried my best to take back the meme's narrative by creating a video edit of Michael clips to the 50 Cent song \"Many Men\".  I posted it on YouTube with the title [\"MJ Thug the Movie\"](https://youtu.be/ne6ScUwvd9o).  Some found it funny. Others found it to be a fitting tribute to the persecution of the man.  It got about 191,000 views.  I appreciated that the MJ fans seemed to get the spirit it was intended.  I ended that video with a money shot of that original mjthug.jpg.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Footnote to all of this, a year after MJ's death they released the posthumous \"Michael\" album that featured the track [\"Monster\"](https://youtu.be/DpUMqmptSk0) with newly recorded vocals from 50 Cent.  This finally fulfilled the years-long rumor of their collaboration.  However, as I'm sure many of the hardcore fans here are aware, a fresh bout of controversy surfaced with many fans/family members questioning the authenticity of MJ's vocals.  \n",
      "\n",
      "----\n",
      "\n",
      "And so ends the story of this weird piece of early internet history during the infancy of memes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**I recently became familiar with the concept of NFT (non-fungible tokens)** where people are selling/trading digital art and memes via blockchain.  I've seen [some recent reports](https://youtu.be/TWBbF1HwqvE) and read [the explanation on the NFT subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/NFT/comments/kw8tu3/what_are_nfts_how_to_mint_an_nft_why_are_nfts/), but I gotta be honest it's still slightly going over my head.  I assume there are some people here way more versed in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But nonetheless, a friend of mine insisted that I auction off my original mjthug.jpg meme (file has a creation date of November 24, 2003) and walked me through creating a listing for it.  **I don't expect this to get much attention.  I just see it as a fitting end to the story of my MJ meme.  So if you're interested in owning the NFT, I've thrown it up on mintable with a starting bid of $1:  https://mintable.app/art/item/MJ-Thug--Michael-Jackson-after-Prison--viral-image-from-2003--Viral-Michael-Jackson-and-50-Cent-photoshop-mashup-meme-circa-2003/YFw8pcVrFSkjxy5**\n",
